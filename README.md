# Web Development
This repository contains three folders:
  - **HTML**
  - **CSS**
  - **JavaScript**

## HTML
The HTML folder contains the foundational structure of the web application, built using semantic HTML. It includes static elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms that define the layout and content of web pages. Core tags like `<div>`, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, and `<form>` are used, following best practices such as using meaningful alt text, proper nesting, and self-closing tags where applicable.

This folder demonstrates the use of relative and absolute paths in hyperlinks (href), internal page navigation using id, and form elements like `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` with correct usage of action, method, and name attributes. HTML5 validation features are implemented to ensure input accuracy.

The files also illustrate proper use of id and class attributes for styling and scripting purposes. This folder acts as the static skeleton, ready for styling via CSS and interactivity via JavaScript.

## CSS
The CSS folder contains all stylesheets that define the visual presentation of the web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to format HTML elements through properties such as color, layout, font, and spacing. This folder includes examples of inline, internal, and external styles, with external CSS being the most maintainable and reusable. Styles are applied using selectors like element, class (`.className`), ID (`#id`), attribute, and pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:nth-child`).

It demonstrates key concepts like the box model (margin, border, padding, content), specificity rules, and the order of precedence (inline > internal > external). Styling includes layout control using width, height, min/max constraints, units (%, px), and background properties. Color is defined via names, hex codes, and `rgb()` values. Structural pseudo-classes and responsive formatting practices are also illustrated. CSS in this folder ensures consistency, accessibility, and responsiveness across all linked HTML pages.
