This repository contains three folders:

- **HTML/**: Contains basic HTML files for structure and content.
- **CSS/**: Contains stylesheets for visual design.
- **JavaScript/**: Contains scripts to add interactivity.

üìÅ HTML/
The HTML/ folder contains the foundational structure of the web application, built using semantic HTML. It includes static elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms that define the layout and content of web pages. Core tags like <div>, <span>, <a>, <img>, and <form> are used, following best practices such as using meaningful alt text, proper nesting, and self-closing tags where applicable.

This folder demonstrates the use of relative and absolute paths in hyperlinks (href), internal page navigation using id, and form elements like <input>, <select>, and <textarea> with correct usage of action, method, and name attributes. HTML5 validation features are implemented to ensure input accuracy.

The files also illustrate proper use of id and class attributes for styling and scripting purposes. This folder acts as the static skeleton, ready for styling via CSS and interactivity via JavaScript.
