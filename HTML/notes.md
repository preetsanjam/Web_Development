## **Notes**

- Attributes only appear in the opening tag.
- Attributes are always given as key-value pairs.
- The body tag contains all tags that will be rendered on the web page.
- Meta tag should not have a closing tag.
- The id attribute for meta and title tags cannot be the same.
- Standalone tags or self-closing tags have no separate closing tags or content involved. For example, hr and br tags.
- The br tag is a self-closing tag used for breaking into a new line.
- The anchor tag is used to create a clickable link to another webpage. It helps in navigating between pages. It has one important attribute, namely **"href"**
- The href attribute, which stands for hypertext reference, is an essential attribute in the anchor tag that takes the url of the destination tag. The anchor tag won't redirect users without this attribute.
- There are two types of **href paths**
    - **Absolute path** is the complete path of a particular file in a file system.
    - **Relative path** is the location of a file in relation to our current location in a file system.

     **Absolute path vs relative path**
     - If we are in a folder and the destination/relative file is in the same folder, we can use the relative path. Absolute paths are used to refer to files in a completely separate folder. Relative path does not expsose all folders on our system.
     - In order to move one level up for relative paths, we use the '../' operator.
