## **Notes**

- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allow us to format components on an HTML web page. This formatting can be done by color, position, font size or font family, and many more.
- There are three main ways to add CSS to an HTML page: 
    - Inline
    - Internal (also called embedded)
    - External CSS
- **Inline CSS**: Inline styles are attached to one HTML tag at a time. We do so by using the style attribute of the tag. The syntax for this is:
    `<tagname style='property1: value1; property2: value2;...;property n: value n;'`
- There are three ways of giving colors in CSS:
    - Using color names. For example: yellow
    - Using hexadecimal values. For example: #FFF00
    - Using RGB values. For example: rgb(255,255,0)
