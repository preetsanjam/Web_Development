## **Notes**

- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allow us to format components on an HTML web page. This formatting can be done by color, position, font size or font family, and many more.
- There are three main ways to add CSS to an HTML page: 
    - Inline
    - Internal (also called embedded)
    - External CSS
