## **Notes** ##

- JavaScript is a scripting language, which means it is loosely defined. 
- A loosely typed language is a programming language where is no need for variables to be defined. It is easier to debug and test your code using loosely typed languages.  
- Compile time errors are detected by the compiler and occur when we violate the syntax rules. It indicates that we need to fix the error before compiling the code.
- JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. The browser picks up the Javascript code line by line. It is not compiled and translated to some other form.
**Main features of JavaScript:** 
- JavaScript is interpreted line by line.
- We can build backend of an application using JavaScript.
- JavaScript is the only language for writing scripts for the frontend of an application.
