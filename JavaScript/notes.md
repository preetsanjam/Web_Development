## **Notes** ##

- JavaScript is a scripting language, which means it is loosely defined. 
- A loosely typed language is a programming language where there is no need for variables to be defined. It is easier to debug and test your code using loosely typed languages.  
- Compile time errors are detected by the compiler and occur when we violate the syntax rules. It indicates that we need to fix the error before compiling the code.
- JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. The browser picks up the Javascript code line by line. It is not compiled and translated to some other form.
- **Main features of JavaScript:** 
    - JavaScript is interpreted line by line.
    - We can build the backend of an application using JavaScript.
    - JavaScript is the only language for writing scripts for the frontend of an application.
- In JavaScript, a primitive data type is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. A few primitive data types include number, string, boolean, NULL, etc.
- A variable that is declared and not assigned a value is of type 'undefined'.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript framework for backend development. It is a runtime environment which developers use to create server-side web applications. 
- 'npm' stands for Node Package Manager. It is the world's largest Software Registry containing over 800,000 code packages. 'npm' is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. 
- V8 is a free and open-source JavaScript engine developed by the Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers. V8 engine directly converts scripts to machine code without building any intermediate code, making it different from other JS engines. 
- In JavaScript, non-primitive data types are derived from primitive data types. These are called reference types because they refer to objects. The data type values can be altered hence known as mutable data types.  
- There is no explicit data typing in JavaScript.
- The `typeof` operator in JavaScript is designed to return a string that represents the data type of a given operand. Regardless of the operand's actual type, the typeof operator will always evaluate to one of the following strings:
"string", "number", "boolean", "object", "function", "undefined", "symbol", and "bigint".
- The concat() method is used to combine/merge two or more strings. It does not change the existing string, but returns a new string.
