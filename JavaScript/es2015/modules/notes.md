## Notes

- A **module** is essentially a JavaScript file, but we instruct the runtime to treat it in a special wayâ€”specifically, as a module. This allows the runtime to manage what the file exposes to the outside world and what it keeps private. A module can decide which functions, classes or variables should be accessible from other files, and which ones should remain internal. This encapsulation helps in organizing and reusing code effectively.
